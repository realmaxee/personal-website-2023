        <p>Hello! My name is Max Kadoshnikov, and I'm currently a student at the University of Victoria in beautiful Victoria, BC. When I'm not studying computer science and engineering, you can usually find me pursuing one of my many hobbies, which include cars, 3D printing, filming and cinematography, photography, and more.
            <br><br>
            As a lifelong tinkerer and problem solver, I've always been drawn to the worlds of engineering and computer science. I love nothing more than diving into complex problems and working to find creative solutions that make a real difference. Whether I'm building a new 3D-printed component for my car or writing code for a challenging software project, I always approach my work with a focus on quality, attention to detail, and a deep passion for what I do.
            <br><br>
            If you're interested in learning more about my skills and experience as a computer science and engineering student, or if you have a project you think I'd be a good fit for, please don't hesitate to get in touch! I'm always eager to connect with others who share my interests and passions.</p>
